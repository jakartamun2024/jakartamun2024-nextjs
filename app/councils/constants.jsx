        The United Nations Children's Fund—abbreviated to UNICEF—is an
        international organization that focuses on assisting children worldwide
        through humanitarian and developmental aid. First established in 1946,
        the organization acted as a relief for children who have been severely
        impacted by the second World War. By 1950, the organization's direction
        was shifted into creating and implementing programs that would generally
        help increase children's welfare, hence extending UNICEF's mandate
        indefinitely. Since then, UNICEF has collaborated with over 190
        countries, prioritizing its work in less-developed regions and is known
        to actively participate in assisting children in various emergency
        situations.
        <br />
        <br />
        UNICEF's programs have been guided by the Convention of the Rights of
        the Child (1986), which explores means of child development and their
        indivisible rights. Additionally, they are mandated in assisting the
        attainment of the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) worldwide -
        being, to ensure a form of sustainable development that is
        “child-centered”. Amongst its many child welfare frameworks includes the
        Child Friendly City Initiative (CFCI), which calls for the inclusion of
        children in public-private discussions to create living spaces that
        support child development. May it be child health, education, or other
        forms of rights, UNICEF remains consistent in improving forms of
        development for children worldwide.

        Communities should be livable for all - where everyone is guaranteed
        safety, comfort, and freedom of self-development. Hence, a
        child-friendly city is formed when a city is able to accommodate
        children and promotes their rights to the fullest extent in ensuring
        their livelihood. This can be seen through the design of the city's
        infrastructure, the inclusion of children in any and all governmental
        decisions, as well as the provision of basic necessities and facilities.
        However, due to the multitude of city development priorities—such as
        accommodating affluent newcomers, increasing attractiveness for
        investors, and others— ensuring child friendliness has been put on the
        last of their concerns. May it be school shootings, child marriages, or
        child labour, cases of atrocities towards child welfare have become
        increasingly common, with government and private actors turning a blind
        eye towards these crimes. These acts are a form of violation against the
        UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, amidst differences of
        financial capacities between Member States, could existing definitions
        of child-friendly cities be achieved in all countries? From this
        situation, delegates are expected to be able to collaborate to put forth
        a solution that can align the needs for a child-friendly city, all the
        while exploring new and improved ways in safeguarding and creating a
        comfortable childhood for all children.

        The International Labour Organization was founded in 1919 under the
        League of Nations, making it one of the first and oldest specialized
        agencies of the United Nations. Its mandate is to promote economic and
        social justice through the creation of international labor standards. In
        more than a hundred years of its existence, the agency has developed 191
        labor standards covering various aspects of labor rights to keep up with
        the ever changing challenges in the workplace, from technological
        development to globalization.
        <br />
        <br />
        The organization's unique tripartite structure brings together the
        government, employer, and worker of its member states, unlike any other
        UN agencies. Those members then meet annually in an International Labour
        Conference to set the agency's policy and conventions. This structure
        assists ILO's efforts in actualizing the Decent Work Agenda, which sets
        a common objective for Member States to achieve full and productive
        employment, and decent work, by 2030. Come join our fight in realizing
        economic equality for all!

        The advent of automation—including generative artificial intelligence
        (AI)—in the past decade has shocked everyone by its capability to
        perform creative and high-skilled jobs previously thought to be
        irreplaceable by machines. It takes almost no time for employers to
        incorporate this new technology into the workplace to maximize their
        output.
        <br />
        <br />
        The threat of automation to blue-collar work has been well understood,
        with many related strikes occurring before the 20th century. Yet, its
        presence has become increasingly threatening due to the renewed
        utilization of automation in replacing white-collar jobs, now putting
        workers in creative and knowledge economies on the line. This tension is
        reflected in the strike held by the Writers Guild of America from May to
        September 2023 which demanded the restriction on the use of AI in
        scriptwriting. Without mutually agreed upon standards for the use of
        this new technology, its brisk advancement and usage would only lead to
        more labor disputes to pop up. It then becomes imperative for
        delegates-who will take the role of governments, employers, and
        workers-to once again engage in the evolving debate of how to utilize
        automation in a way that benefits everybody involved, but with a new
        industry and technology to reconcile.

        Replacing the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) in 2006,
        the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is a body under the
        United Nations that promotes and protects human rights globally. The
        council is mandated to address violations of rights that are outlined in
        the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the UN Charter, and
        to thematically engage in all human rights issues. To act upon this
        mandate, the UNHRC is equipped with special procedures—also called the
        Special Rapporteurs—which are special teams that handle the
        investigation of certain issues related to human rights breaches in
        specific territories; currently, the special rapporteurs work under 45
        human rights themes. Aside from that, every four years, the UNHRC also
        conducts the Universal Periodic Review, which is an assessment of member
        states' human rights implementation. All in all, the UNHRC assumes the
        role of the world's primary human rights body.

        Bigotry comes in many names, and trickles into many dimensions. Hence,
        Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) highlights
        the importance of protecting social minorities—made up of gender, race,
        political leanings, sexuality, or other identity markers—from
        discrimination done by civilians and people in power. However,
        governments and law enforcers have been criticized for exhibiting biases
        in the forms of violent acts, identity-based profiling, unjust court
        proceedings, and others. Arguably, this is one of the signs that the law
        and its enforcement have been misused to further negative biases against
        these communities. Concerningly, many of these treatments are being
        justified as security measures. The War on Terror, #BlackLivesMatter
        movement, and the Mahsa Amini protests are several amongst many examples
        of “public emergencies” that justify rising frequencies of arrests made
        to “upkeep national peace”. Most of the people arrested during these
        “public instabilities” include Muslims, black people, as well as women
        respectively - all of which are social minorities. In light of these
        recent trends, Member States are urged to question: is the law
        compromisable in the face of possible public security threats? Or, are
        these acts deplorable under any circumstances and undermine the criminal
        justice's spirit of fairness?

        ability of the tourism sector to be better and positive, including the
        tourism sector that focuses on the progress of the 17 Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs). Beyond the SDGs, the UNWTO is spirited in
        actuating their 2018 Management Vision, which comprises of five pillars:
        (1) actuating innovation-based tourism; (2) increasing the
        competitiveness of the tourism sector at every level and scale by
        expanding the number of investments and entrepreneurial actors; (3)
        creating jobs and provide relevant training to increase absorption of
        productive age workers; (4) creating resilient, safe, and smooth tourism
        travel; and (5) maximize the unique potential of the tourism sector in
        protecting cultural and natural heritage, all the while giving
        socioeconomic support to surrounding communities. The Organization is a
        major player in safeguarding the resilience of cultural tourism
        worldwide - as seen through the Istanbul Declaration, highlighting the

        “Wonderful Indonesia”,“Sieraously Surprising”, and “Incredible India”.
        These are only several amongst a multitude of tourism slogans promoting
        a nation's diversity of cultures and destinations. These slogans
        acknowledge the role of culture in inciting curiosity and value-sharing
        between communities. Contemporarily, however, the role of culture in a
        society has undergone a crucial shift. If culture initially serves as a
        source of identity, its role has expanded to forward a nation's
        development at large. We see this with how culture-driven tourism is
        titled as the most on-demand tourism sector of the decade. Beyond
        concerns of this shift, the mainstreaming of culture begs a more
        pressing question: is this sector of tourism <em>sustainable?</em> May
        it be revenue volatility, enterprise-driven exploitation, or social
        changes due to the influx of tourists, cultural tourism has been
        criticized for being unsustainable. Most concerningly, management of
        cultural tourism has arguably forgotten one of its core purposes, being
        to safeguard and promote the appreciation of local cultures. Hence,
        Member States are urged to not only bridge the dissenting views
        surrounding sustainable cultural tourism, but to also consider the views
        of native communities.

        European football is currently in crisis as inequalities continues to
        grow when every year big clubs spend billions of dollars to buy new
        players while leaving the other clubs with nothing. This overspending
        problem leads to the unequal opportunities for small clubs to compete in
        the league with bigger clubs. It has been proven by the fact that in the
        past decade, the champions in Europe`s top 5 leagues are only clubs that
        spend the most in the transfer windows, and the clubs that can not spend
        as much are most likely to get relegated. Back in 2009, UEFA introduced
        the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rule to curb overspending from every club
        in Europe. However, so far it has proven to be a failure and it does not
        stop big clubs from spending even more than they earn every year. Due to
        that, to prevent some big teams from “killing” the excitement of
        football as well as to create a more equal chance for every club to
        compete, delegates are expected to discuss and come up with solutions to
        limit the spending of every European football club and to create
        healthier and more financially stable regulations.

        First held in 1997, the World Water Forum is a byproduct of the World

        worldwide. The Forum assembles on a triannual basis, in which each of
        its meetings is centered on a Thematic Framework curated to improve
        water access and supply. The output of this Forum is to produce a global
        framework, proposed to raise awareness among decision-makers and the

        With doubled demands for clean water since 1960, ensuring reliable and
        quality water supply has become increasingly challenging, especially
        noting the impact of climate change towards water scarcity. In spite of
        government efforts to establish best practices for water management,
        trends of industry-led water contamination have virtually undermined
        these efforts. A lack of corporate social responsibility—may it be in
        technicalities or overall willingness—has resulted in the mismanagement
        of waste products, increased chemical pollution, and overall inability
        to predict water risks. With the umbrella theme of{" "}

        The Arctic region has long been targeted as an arena between competing
        powers. As a region storing the largest known concentration of rare
        metals, oil, and gas, interest for the Arctic region has skyrocketed
        again per the last decade. Owing to climate change and melting ice caps,
        self-vested environmental and economic goals have not only endangered
        the continuity of cooperation, but have also added facets to “threats to
        peace and stability” in the Arctic region. As NATO's Strategic Concept
        nears its second anniversary, whether or not the Strategy's commitment
        to “collective defense and interests” is upheld becomes ambiguous at
        best. Although the High North is considered as an international domain,
        national interests become further involved as more than 14 million km²
        of the Arctic region becomes new, tempting trade routes and novel deep

        military presence begs the question: what does NATO define as “threats

        The Indo-Pacific Ocean is an undeniable region of political interest. It
        is a frontier for a myriad of geopolitical disputes, and therefore, the
        peaceful coexistence of nations in the Indo-Pacific relies on the lack
        of “aggressive” expansion and balancing of power. Against this backdrop,
        the establishment of the 2021 security pact consisting of Australia,
        United Kingdom, and United States—popularly abbreviated as AUKUS—has
        been a heated discussion for many. As a pact spirited in becoming a
        joint deterrence force and to uphold peace and stability, the pact not
        only challenges neighboring alliances, but also raises concerns as to
        how this pact would shift pre existing order within the region.
        Ultimately, AUKUS posits an important question: what is necessary for
        countries to feel safe? As criticized to be a new effort for political
        expansion—coupled with the usage of the region as a possible area for
        testing defensive technologies, some of which are nuclear powered—the
        existence of a foreign, opposing pacts in the Indo-Pacific region is a
        delicate subject for not only neighboring alliances, but also to
        non-involved nations due to its disruptive implications. Therefore,
        Member States are urged to discuss means of reforming the current
        security order in the Indo-Pacific region, whilst treading on clashing
        sovereignty claims.
